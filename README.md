## Description
SafeSpace is a Discord Bot which aims to reduce toxicity in Discord Servers through virtue of an affirmed TOS system and automated offensive message detection.

## About
This bot was created by Alyan, Jonathan, and Taleiven, with the vision of eradicating oppression and marginalization issues in Discord communities. In May of 2021, we set out to create a tool that would allow Discord users to reduce negativity in their servers through the regulation/enforcement of server terms of service and through server message moderation.

The SafeSpace Discord Bot contains a verification system. Upon joining, new users will be required to agree to a server's rules, as well as terms and conditions. This can be done with a reaction to the verification message, which will then grant the user access to the server.
