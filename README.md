## Description
SafeSpace is a discord bot which aims to reduce toxicity in discord servers through virtue of an affirmed TOS system.

## About
This bot was created by Alyan, Jonathan, and Taleiven, with the vision of eradicating oppression and marginalization issues in Discord communities. In May of 2021, we set out to create a tool that would enable Discord users to reduce negativity in their servers through the regulation/enforcement of server terms of service and through server message moderation.
